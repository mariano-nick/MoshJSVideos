Javascript Notes

Best practice: put script code at the bottom of the page, since it is read top to bottom	
	JS can slow down loading of page unnecessarily
// are used for comments
HTML is all abount content - JS is all about behavior
Node is a run time environment for executing javascript code

JS uses three equals === for equality
	Uses !== for not equal
	Actually has == as well	

=== is strict equality operator
	ensures that both variables have the same type and value

== is loose equality
	the run time looks to the left side, and converts the right to the same type
	example: true == 1 
		converts 1 to bool, since left is bool
		true expression
		
Most of the time we use the strict operator


let points = 110;
let type = points > 100 ? 'gold' : 'silver';
// conditional operator
// condition ? if true this value : otherwise this value


You can use logical operators with non booleans
	Logical expressions are not always booleans
	It will just repeat the second operand
	false || 'Nick'   -- returns 'Nick'
	Looks for truthy or falsy
		These are treated like false (falsy) - undefined, null, 0, false, '', NaN (not a number)
	Everything that's not falsy, is truthy
	As soon as a truthy is found, that operand is returned
		false || 1 || 2  -- returns true, since 1 is truthy

bitwise or is a single |
	1 | 2  -- 3
	1 = 00000001
	2 = 00000010
	1 | 2
	R = 00000011  -- 3
	used for things like permissions - read / write / execute
	if first 5 bits are useless, then read bit, write bit, execute bit
	read permissions = 00000100 == 4
	write permission = 00000010 == 2
	execute permission = 00000001 == 1
	
	let myPermission = 0;
	myPermission = myPermission | readPermission | writePermission;
	myPermission == 6 (4 + 2)
	
	let message = (myPermission & readPermission) ? yes : no;
		if this is true, you have read permission
		
	Bitwise TAKEAWAY - the or operator | can add capabilities, the and operator & can check those capabilities
	

Javascript has operator precedence


for in loop is used to iterate over the properties of an object
	can also be used when you don't know the property name at runtime
	Example:
		const person = {
		name: 'Nick',
		age: 30
		};

		for (let key in person)
			console.log(person[key]);
		
		// Output:
		// Nick
		// 30
		

Remember the conditional statement - can help have more compact code
	function max (a, b)
		return (a > b) ? a : b;
	no need to write a conditional if you're just returning true/false
		function isLandscape(width, height)
			return (width > height);


If you have nested loops, break the nested one out into another function - you usually can


Javascript objects are full of key value pairs, those values can be functions
	If a function is part of an object, we call it a method

Factory functions = something like createCircle, returns a circle object
	Uses camelCase
	We can just define the circle object, without naming it
		function createCircle() {
			return {
				object implementation;
			};
		}
	we can also define functions in an object better than using a key, value pairs
		object {
			myFunction(){
				function implementation;
			}
		}

Constructor functions = 
	Uses PascalNotation
	this is a reference to an object that is executing this bit of code
	Basically acts like a class definition
		function Circle(radius){
			this.radisu = radius;
			this.draw = function(){
				console.log('draw')
			}
		}
		let circle = new Circle(2);


Both constructor functions and factory functions are the same, it's just a matter of opinion which you use
	Constructor functions are more familiar to people that know C#/Java, so just use that
	

Objects are dynamic - you can always add or remove properties/functions whenever you want
Even if an object is a constant, you can still add or remove properties/functions from it
	You just cannot reassign that varaible name to another object

When using an object literal notation, the Javascript engine calls an Object contructor function for you
	let x = {}
	is the same as
	let x = new Object();

Other built in constructors
	new String(); == '' or ""
	new Boolean(); == true or false
	new Number(); == 1, 2, 3
	
Every object has a constructor property, and that refernces the function that was used to create that object


Functions are just objects too 
	They have a default constructor - Function() - seen with function.constructor
	They have a name property - the name of the function
	

Functions are just objects, they have built in properties and methods, along with any that you create in that function

const circle1 = new Circle(1) -- this is the same as Circle.call({}, 1)
	When we use the call function, we pass in an empty object, which sets the context for 'this' in the function
	This exact same thing happens when we use the new keyword, just behind the scenes
	
We can use the apply function to pass arguments in an array
	Circle.call({}, 1, 2, 3, 4) -- this is the exact same as Circle.apply({}, [1, 2, 3, 4]
	The apply function is great if you already have all the arguments in an array

In Javascript, functions are objects!!

2 categories of types -- value types (aka primitive types) and reference types
	Value types = Number, String, Boolean, Symbol, undefined, null
	Reference types = Objects, Functions, Array -- both Functions and Arrays are actually objects as well


Value types variables are independent of other value type variables
	When you set one value type to another, the value is just copied from one to the other

Reference types do not do this, we instead store the value of that varible in memory, and then reference the memory location
	The variable does NOT contain the actual value for that variable
	
Primitives are copied by their value
Objects are copied by their reference

Scope works similarly as you'd expect in other languages, a function holds the scope of only those variables inside/passed to the function
